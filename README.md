# Linear Algebra

This repo aims to implement some well-known linear algebra algorithms in a 
readable and easy to understand way.  
Established libraries such as BLAS, LAPACK, Eigen etc. offer great performance
and precision, but the code is often hard to read.

## Disclaimer

While the code is definitely useful as a linear algebra library, don't use it
in critical applications. Use Eigen instead, it'll be faster, numerically more
accurate, and more reliable.
